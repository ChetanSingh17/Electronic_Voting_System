# Electronic_Voting_System
here is an overview of the Admin role in an electronic voting system:

Approve voters' requests: The Admin is responsible for approving voters' requests to participate in an election. This includes verifying that the voter is eligible to vote and that they have provided all of the required information.
See the results of voting: The Admin is able to see the results of voting once the election has been completed. This includes the number of votes cast for each candidate or ballot measure.
The Admin may also have other responsibilities, such as:
Managing the voter registration database
Configuring the voting system
The Admin role is an important one in ensuring the integrity of an electronic voting system. By carefully approving voters' requests and monitoring the system for security vulnerabilities, the Admin can help to ensure that the election is conducted fairly and accurately.
